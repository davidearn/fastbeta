\section{Changes in version 0.1.1 (2023-11-28)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Changes are logged in \file{inst/NEWS.Rd}.

    \item \code{Depends: R (>= 4.3.0)} for \verb{amsmath} in PDF
    output, which was not supported until 4.2.2.

    \item \file{DESCRIPTION} sets \code{BuildResaveData: no},
    so that \command{R CMD build} works without
    \option{--no-resave-data} when \pkg{fastbeta} is not installed.

    \item \file{data/*.R} are copied into \file{inst/scripts}
    at install time by a \command{make} rule in \code{src/Makevars}.

    \item Typo in \file{src/sir.c} triggering \option{-Wformat}
    is fixed.
