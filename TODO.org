* TODO fastbeta 0.3.3

** TODO less boilerplate in examples and tests
	The main problems stem from subscripting the time series that are
	needed and from getting parameters values stored as attributes into
	a call.  The wrangling is not interesting or useful and it gives the
	impression that usage is complicated.
** TODO more comprehensive tests for correctness
	Notably, for deterministic simulations, it should be tested that
	the back-calculated time series are equal to the latent ones within
	a tolerance.  This applies to 'fastbeta', 'ptpi', and 'deconvolve'.

* DONE fastbeta 0.3.1

** DONE 'seir': provide option to aggregate infected subcompartments
	rowSums(x[, colnames(x) == "E"]), ditto "I"
** DONE 'fastbeta.matrix': export and document
** DONE 'seir': handle early termination due to root finding
